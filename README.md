# Sales Operations Analytics

This repository contains practical, real-world examples of Sales Operations and Revenue Operations work.

The goal is to demonstrate how I approach:
- messy business questions
- sales data analysis
- automation of repetitive tasks
- turning data into clear decisions

## What you'll find here
- SQL queries focused on sales funnels, conversion rates, and revenue tracking
- Lightweight Python scripts for data cleaning and analysis
- Examples of automation logic (Zapier / Make / n8n style workflows)
- Clear explanations written for non-technical stakeholders

## Why this repo exists
I built this repository to showcase how I think and work, not just tools I know.

My focus is:
- clarity over complexity  
- automation over manual work  
- impact over dashboards nobody uses  

This repo is intentionally practical and business-oriented.

## Tools & concepts
- SQL (joins, CTEs, window functions)
- Python (Pandas, basic ETL)
- Sales & Revenue Operations
- Automation-first mindset
- Data quality & source-of-truth thinking
